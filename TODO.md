# To-Do List

* Separate some logic into separate files/classes.
* Rewrite inline documentation to match `urldecode`'s format.
* Profile performance on a per-request basis to identify bottlenecks.
* Consider adding `Range` header support to allow partial downloads.
* Rewrite `README.md` to contain updated information (when other items on this
  list completed).
